# Submit an Anyscale job, retrying only when the cluster never acquired its GPUs.
#
# On-demand 4xL4 (g6.12xlarge) capacity in us-east-1 is frequently exhausted. When
# that happens the Anyscale control plane cycles availability zones, gives up, and
# terminates the cluster with "failed to acquire min nodes" -- the job goes from
# STARTING straight to FAILED without the entrypoint ever executing. That is a
# capacity problem, not a test problem, so we resubmit instead of failing CI.
#
# Reaching RUNNING is NOT that signal. The CLI collapses Anyscale's internal HA job
# states onto a handful of user-facing ones, and ERRORED / CLEANING_UP / RESTARTING
# all map to RUNNING (see HA_JOB_STATE_TO_JOB_STATE in anyscale/job/_private/job_sdk.py)
# because ERRORED is transient when retries remain. So a cluster that dies during
# provisioning still reports STARTING -> RUNNING for the few seconds it spends tearing
# itself down, and `job wait --state RUNNING` exits 0 on it.
#
# What actually distinguishes the two cases is whether Anyscale ever created a *job
# run*: a run exists only once the cluster came up and the entrypoint was submitted to
# it. So the gate is applied after the job settles -- if it failed without a run, it
# never got GPUs and we resubmit; if it failed with one, the tests really failed and
# we report it as-is.
#
# Usage: ci/submit_anyscale_job.sh <config-file> <job-name> <run-timeout-s> [start-timeout-s]
#
# <job-name> must be unique to the invocation. `job status` and `job wait` resolve a
# name to the most recently created job carrying it, so a name shared with a
# concurrent run would let the two poll each other's jobs. The CI workflows get this
# from `github.run_id` plus `github.run_attempt`; anything else calling this script
# is responsible for its own unique suffix.
#
# Env overrides:
#   ANYSCALE_CLOUD           cloud to submit to (default sky-anyscale-aws-us-east-1)
#   CAPACITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS    submissions before giving up (default 10)
#   CAPACITY_RETRY_DELAY_S   sleep between attempts (default 300)
