"""Megatron backend workers.

The package import runs :func:`patch_fa4_cute_import` first: with the pinned flash-attn and
the cutlass DSL that vLLM >= 0.28 pulls in, ``import megatron.bridge`` otherwise aborts on a
broken FlashAttention-4 probe (see the patch module). Every Megatron entry point in SkyRL
lives under this package, so this is the earliest common place to apply it.
